# ToDoList-with-saving-file-system
##### Write and manage your notes with saving file-system #####
How does it work?
1) You specify the path to the folder to be used.
You can also open a recent folder.
2) The project folder contains a "config.txt" file that contains path information. This information is needed to quickly open a recent folder.
3) You enter notes, and they are saved (updated) in this folder in the "test.txt" file (you can easily change the save name).
==============================================================================================================================================
What do I want to add next?
1) Ability to view a list of created saves
2) Create new notes in the same folder with a custom name
3) Delete saves
4) Delete notes in a file
5) Change the color of notes
6) Add a date (and time?) next to each note.
7) Add a limit?
